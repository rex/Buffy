    "biography": "A native of Southern California, Julia Ling first expressed her creative  side at age 3 when she drew pictures of her parents drinking tea. By  age 6, her artwork had been featured in local magazines, festivals and  newspapers, including the Pasadena Star News, which gave her a  front-page spread. Also at age 6, Ling wrote and narrated a creative  story that won her the \"Best Storyteller Award\" by the Chinese World  Newspaper. By age 9, Ling was performing award-winning solo dances  throughout California, and her umbrella dances had aired on national  television.\n\nIn high school, Ling was student body president and  president of German Club, Amnesty International, Literature Society and  Junior Statesmen Debate Team. She competed in dance, varsity tennis and  swimming. In 1997, Congressman David Dreier recognized Ling for her  community service at the local hospital. At age 16, she was selected as a  state finalist in the Miss America Pageant and after nine years of  playing the piano, graduated from the Royal Board of Music. She  graduated high school second in her class with a 4.0 GPA and perfect SAT  scores.\n\nPursuing a career in medicine, Ling majored in  biomedical chemical engineering at the University of California, Los  Angeles. She was Treasurer of Chemical Engineering Society, Vice  President of the Engineering Society of UCLA and honorary member of the  Society of Women Engineers. She left it all to pursue her love of  performing.\n\nIn 2003, Julia Ling made her network television debut  on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, playing opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar.  Over the next two years, she starred in over 20 independent short films  and returned to prime time television in roles on House (FOX) and ER  (NBC) in 2006. She guest starred in the recurring role of Kim Tao on the  critically acclaimed Studio 60 On the Sunset Strip (NBC). Her next  major guest starring role was on the television drama ER, playing the  recurring character of Mae Lee Park, a surgical intern. She also guest  starred in The O.C., and Grey's Anatomy.\n\nMost notably known for  her work on prime time television, Ling starred as the popular Anna Wu  on NBC's CHUCK. After voicing and filming the live action character  \"Izumi\" for the video game, Command and Conquer (EA), Ling toured the  world for autograph signing and charity fundraising.\n\nIn the 2007  Jackie Chan Disciples martial arts competition, Ling was selected as one  of the top four finalists to compete in the International Top 100. Her  performance also won her \"Best Acting Award\". In 2011, Ling joined the  cast of FOX sitcom, I Hate My Teenage Daughter and voiced a sketch for  Conan O'Brien.\n\nMost recently, she worked on a movie performing  opposite Academy Award winner Adrien Brody. The movie will premiere in  theaters June, 2012.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom IMDb;\n\nBorn December 15, 1964, the son of a dairy farmer in Shafer, Minnesota (population 81), Brett Rickaby attended Chisago Lakes High School where, as a senior, he received a letter from a professor at the University of Minnesota in Duluth encouraging him to attend their theatre program. Taking this as a sign, he enrolled at UMD and did not get cast in a single production his first year. Briefly, he considered hanging it up to become a tree trimmer, but re-dedicated himself and was cast in seven full-scale productions his sophomore year. By his senior year (1987) he had won what is roughly the acting equivalent of Heisman Trophy, The National Irene Ryan Acting Award at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\nThat fall he received a scholarship to attend New York University's MFA program with contemporaries and classmates Peter Krause (\"Six Feet Under\" (2001)), Camryn Manheim (\"The Practice\" (1997), Marcia Gay Harden (Pollock (2000)), Rainn Wilson (\"The Office\" (2005)) and Debra Messing (\"Will &amp; Grace\" (1998)), and originated two plays with Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and director Tony Kushner (\"Angels in America\" (2003)).\nRickaby performed in numerous New York and regional theatre productions including The New York Shakespeare Festival, The Roundabout and The Actors Theatre of Louisville. In 1995, he was hired by Nicholas Hytner (The Madness of King George (1994)) to play Jigger Craigin in the National Tour of \"Carousel\" with Patrick Wilson (Hard Candy (2005)).\nIn front of the camera, Rickaby has demonstrated a wide range of looks and sensibilities but is mostly known for playing a variety of psychopaths, sociopaths and other disturbed individuals.",

He attended Basic Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and A.I.T. at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He transferred to The University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh upon his return, where he graduated in 1995 with a degree in Radio/TV/Film.\n\nMike belonged to the 432nd Civil Affairs Battalion in Green Bay, Wisconsin. His Army Reserve Unit was one of the first to be activated for Operation Joint Endeavor after the Dayton Peace Accord was signed. He spent January through July 1996 stationed overseas in Durdevik, Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nAfter his tour was over, Mike found work in the production department for WLUK-TV 11, the FOX affiliate in Green Bay, Wisconsin. His duties included running the audio board during the newscasts and inserting local commercial breaks in-between programs. One of the perks that came along with the job was getting paid to witness The Green Bay Packers march towards their Super Bowl XXXI victory over the New England Patriots.\n\nFittingly, Mike's first full day as a resident of Los Angeles was April 1st, 1998 (April Fool's Day). His first TV program appearance was a small role as \"Babe Ruth\" in a flashback on an episode of \"Touched by an Angel\" (1994).

    "biography": "Born and raised in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, a small town near \nPittsburgh. He is the middle son of Petro and Despina Maropis and is \nvery close to his brothers, Sam and Chris.\n\nBeing an exceptional \nall-around athlete in high school (Burgettstown High-school in southwest\n Pennsylvania), it appeared Adoni would pursue a professional career in \nsome sport. Turning down various athletic scholarships, he enrolled at \nWest Virginia University and graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor's\n Degree in Business Administration.\n\nBut, from years of being \nentertained by Adoni's impromptu comedic performances and impersonations\n which began when he was a small child, his father, Petro, told him that\n the suit and tie of the business world would probably choke him to \ndeath and encouraged Adoni to give acting a shot. Surprised, yet \nintrigued at this suggestion, Adoni enrolled at a performing arts \nschool, Point Park College (now a University) in Pittsburgh, and studied\n acting, dialects, singing, and a bit of dance.\n\nHis first stage \nrole was as a freshman, even though freshman weren't allowed to perform \nat the time, where they needed him as an \"Arabian Carrier\" in The \nNutcracker Sweet. Not only did Adoni get to flex his muscles in that \nrole, but he also played the \"Jack-in-the-Box\" in the same production. \nSome of his other memorable plays and musicals were: Working, Evita, \nGetting Out, You Can't Take it With You, and Little Shop of Horrors \nwhere he played the man-eating plant, \"Audrey II.\" After three years of \ntheatre at Point Park, with the help of his younger brother Chris, he \nheaded for Hollywood.\n\nAlthough Adoni is truly blessed with a more\n than usual dose of athletic ability and creative talent, what truly \nmakes Adoni stand out is that he is a Type 1 Diabetic, and has been \nsince he was 18 months old. His parents were told he would be weak and \nsickly, and in and out of hospitals his whole life. Ultimately, a \nrenowned diabetic specialist told his father that most likely Adoni \nwould be dead by the age of 25. As Adoni puts it, \"I get a kick out of \nsomeone saying I can't do it.\" This has been proven by his numerous \nathletic awards \nand championships throughout high-school and college which involved \neverything - strength, speed, quickness and finesse. The list includes: \ntennis, basketball, baseball, football, weightlifting, arm-wrestling, \nfitness, and his favorite pastime, which is table tennis (ping-pong). \nAdoni loves being creative with his workouts which involve only 30-45 \nminutes per day of either running, biking, aerobics, some martial arts, \nor what he calls his \"unique, unnatural, yet truly natural Cirque du \nSoleil/Tarzan workout\".\n\nSome of Adoni's diverse and memorable roles include: the flamboyant evil sorcerer, Quan Chi, in the TV show \"Mortal Kombat: Conquest\" (1998), the sarcastic undercover agent in The Gristle (2001), \"Abu-Fayed,\" in Season 6 of the Fox hit series \"24\" (2001) and the regal falcon-man in Hidalgo (2004), starring Viggo Mortensen.  An\n inspiration to the world, Adoni will tell you that the most important \ningredients to success and happiness are - love, laughter, and fitness! \nHe credits his family and a few good friends with supplying all three.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nAshanti Shequoiya Douglas born October 13, 1980 is an American recording artist, record producer and actress who rose to fame in the early 2000s. Ashanti is most famous for her eponymous debut album, which featured the hit song \"Foolish\", and sold over 503,000 copies in its first week of release throughout the U.S. in April 2002. The album set a Soundscan record as the biggest opening week sales for a new female artist, outselling debuts by Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill. In the same week, she became the first female performer to simultaneously hold the top two places on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with \"Foolish\", and \"What's Luv?\" (with Fat Joe). Ashanti broke records again by having three top ten songs, \"Foolish,\" \"What's Luv?\" and \"Always on Time\", on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the same week, being the first woman to accomplish this feat and being second only to the Beatles. In 2003, the self-titled debut album won Ashanti her first Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B album. As of 2008, she has sold more than 27 million albums worldwide. Ashanti ended the decade (2000\u201309) as the third top new R&B artist behind Alicia Keys and Beyonce Knowles. She also ended the decade at number 38 on the Top Artist of the Decade list. As of 2010, Ashanti is listed in the 20 Best Selling Music Singles Since 1990 in History. She ranked #17, with Foolish selling more than 7.4 million copies in the U.S.\nAshanti sang background vocals for Jennifer Lopez on \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\" and wrote and sang background on the song \"Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)\" sung by Jennifer Lopez, both reaching number one on Billboard Hot 100 , which was also in the top 10 charts at the same time as \"Foolish\", \"Always on Time\" (with Ja Rule), and \"What's Luv\" (with Fat Joe). Later that year, she was acclaimed as the \"Princess Of Hip-Hop & R&B\" by her label and capped off her successful debut by winning eight Billboard awards and two American Music Awards. Within seven years of Ashanti's career, she has scored 16 top 40 hits on the Hot 100. Ashanti has endorsed numerous products including Gap, Herbal Essences and Mudd Jeans.\nAshanti cites Janet Jackson, Prince, Madonna, Tupac Shakur, Aaliyah, Tamia, Mary J. Blige, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Yolanda Adams, Toni Braxton, Luther Vandross, The Beatles, The Clark Sisters, Smokey Robinson, Donna Summer, and Blue Magic as her musical influences. Praised as a gifted songwriter by her peers and critics alike, Ashanti has written/co-written the bulk of all her music. She is currently working on her own publishing company entitled Written Entertainment. She released her fourth studio album entitled The Declaration on June 3, 2008 and is currently in the studio working on her fifth. She also performed the charity tune \"Just Stand Up\" alongside 14 other female singers for the \"Stand Up to Cancer\" live television special which helped raise $100 million dollars for cancer research\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ashanti, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",
