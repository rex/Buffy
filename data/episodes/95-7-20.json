Spike and Andrew return with news about the vineyard, but when Spike finds out what happened he hits Faith and leaves, trying to pick up Buffy's scent. The First pays Faith a visit in the form of the Mayor, but she isn't fooled. It tries to unbalance her by saying that Buffy still, and will always think of her only as a killer.
